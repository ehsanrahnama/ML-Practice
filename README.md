# ML-Practice

This repository contains my personal practice and explorations driven by curiosity about machine learning algorithms. It includes several sections so far:

[Linear Algebra](./Linear%20Algebra/)\
[Deep-ML](./Deep-ML/) \
[Visalize Tools](./Visualize%20Tools/)

the Deep-ML folder includes problems and solutions inspired by [Deep-ML](https://www.deep-ml.com/), a fantastic platform similar to LeetCode but focused on data science and deep learning. It offers a wide range of problem categories, including:

*Linear Algebra*

*Machine Learning & Deep Learning*

*Statistics & Probability*

*Natural Language Processing (NLP)*

It's an excellent resource for hands-on practice and building intuition for core concepts in AI and data science.
